## About

This is a project, which I created as a submission for **_Build It Better'24_**, which is a contest of _Cerebro'24_ (annual technical fest of **IIIT Vadodara**).

Basically, in the contest, we're given with some assests provided by the organizers, and we are required to create something using them.

Now, there's a catch. To add more fun, we're allowed to use only pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the technology side, and nothing else. But, we're allowed to use different fonts, icons, etc.

This, contest really helps and motivates to think something unique and come up with something creative, in a time-limit of 24 hrs!
